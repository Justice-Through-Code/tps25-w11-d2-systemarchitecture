Activity: In small groups, design the architecture for your weather dashboard.

Instructions:
    Form groups of 3-4 fellows with similar features

Each person should:
    Draw a component diagram showing:
    
    Core modules (API, Storage, GUI, Processing)
    
    Your 3 chosen features as modules
    
    Arrows showing data flow
    
    Clear boundaries between components

Identify:

    Which components need to communicate
    
    What data passes between components
    
    Where each feature plugs into the core

Discuss architectural decisions:

    Will you use MVC or layered architecture?
    
    How will features access weather data?
    
    Where will shared utilities live?
    

Expected Output:

    Hand-drawn or digital architecture diagram
    
    List of main components and their responsibilities
    
    Data flow documentation
    
    Notes on integration points for features
